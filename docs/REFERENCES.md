## Pillar 1: MPC Stability and Terminal Cost Theory

### Foundational References

**[R1]** J. B. Rawlings and D. Q. Mayne, *Model Predictive Control: Theory, Computation, and Design*, 2nd ed. Madison, WI: Nob Hill Publishing, 2017.
- **Relevance:** Establishes the DARE-based terminal cost framework ($V_f(x) = x^\top P x$ where $P$ solves the DARE) that guarantees recursive feasibility and Lyapunov stability for constrained MPC. Our Phase 0-D fix replaces arbitrary terminal weights with this principled approach.
- **Key Result:** Terminal cost from DARE + terminal constraint set under LQR policy $\kappa_f(x) = Kx$ ensures $V_N^*(x)$ is a Lyapunov function for the closed-loop system.

- **Relevance:** Canonical survey on constrained MPC stability. Provides the three-ingredient recipe (terminal cost, terminal constraint set, local terminal controller) that our architecture must satisfy.

- **Relevance:** Explicit MPC/LQR connections. Shows how offline computation of piecewise-affine control laws eliminates online optimization; motivates our CVXPYgen approach for fast QP solutions.

- **Relevance:** Directly motivates our hybrid LQR-MPC architecture. Proposes a triple-mode scheme (MPC + LQR + NN) with formal stability guarantees under arbitrary switching. Key insight: LQR serves as a computationally cheap fallback that maintains closed-loop stability when MPC is unnecessary.
- **Key Result:** Stability is maintained with any arbitrary neural network of proper dimension, eliminating the need for NN certification; transitions between modes preserve Lyapunov decrease.

- **Relevance:** Demonstrates fuzzy-logic soft switching between MPC and simpler controllers for autonomous vehicles. Validates the concept of risk-aware mode transitions, though their switching is membership-function-based rather than our sigmoid-hysteresis approach.
- **Key Difference:** Our sigmoid blending provides Lipschitz-continuous weight transitions with formal anti-chatter guarantees (Theorem 2), whereas fuzzy switching can exhibit discontinuities.

**[R6]** D. Liberzon, *Switching in Systems and Control*. Boston, MA: Birkhauser, 2003.
- **Relevance:** Provides the theoretical foundation for dwell-time conditions that prevent Zeno behavior in switched systems. Our Theorem 2 (No-Chattering Condition) draws directly from Liberzon's dwell-time stability framework.
- **Key Result:** If the minimum dwell time $\tau_D$ satisfies $\tau_D > \frac{\ln \mu}{\lambda}$ (where $\mu$ is the ratio of Lyapunov functions and $\lambda$ is the decay rate), stability is preserved under arbitrary switching.

- **Relevance:** Extends dwell-time to average dwell-time (ADT), which better models our rate-limited blending weight. Our $\dot{w}_{max}$ directly constrains the ADT.

- **Relevance:** Foundational reference for CBF-based safety guarantees. Defines safety as forward invariance of $\mathcal{C} = \{x : h(x) \geq 0\}$ and provides QP-based safety filters. Our Phase 6 formal theory extension will incorporate CBF constraints into the MPC obstacle avoidance formulation.
- **Key Result:** For control-affine systems $\dot{x} = f(x) + g(x)u$, if $\exists u$ such that $L_f h(x) + L_g h(x) u \geq -\alpha(h(x))$, then $\mathcal{C}$ is forward invariant.
